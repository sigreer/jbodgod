# JBODgod Configuration
#
# Drive Discovery Modes:
#   auto   - (default) Try HBA discovery first, fall back to lsscsi
#   lsscsi - Use lsscsi to discover SCSI/SAS/SATA drives
#   hba    - Use sas3ircu/storcli to discover drives via HBA controller
#   static - Use explicitly configured drives (requires enclosures section)
#
# If discovery is not set and enclosures are defined, static mode is used.
# If discovery is not set and no enclosures are defined, auto mode is used.

# Uncomment to force a specific discovery mode:
# discovery: auto

# Static drive configuration (optional - only needed for static mode)
# When using dynamic discovery, this section can be omitted entirely.
#
# Example static configuration:
# enclosures:
#   - name: jbod1
#     drives:
#       - name: bay1
#         device: /dev/sda
#       - name: bay2
#         device: /dev/sdb
#       # ... add more drives as needed
